# Assignment-MA717
R Markdown analysis for the MA717 Applied Regression assignment using the College dataset: data exploration, linear models, model selection, and polynomial regression diagnostics.

This project contains MA717 Applied Regression coursework. Using the College dataset, I read and explore the data, build simple and multiple linear regression models for Grad.Rate, perform variable selection (forward stepwise with regsubsets), and fit polynomial models with interactions. All analysis is implemented in R/RStudio and documented in an R Markdown file with corresponding knitted PDF report.
